**Silo - Arte e Latitude Rural**, with the support of **Serrapilheira Institute**,  presents **Interactivos?’19: Rural Sciences** 
5 proposals were selected to be developed with the contribution of collaborators in a rural laboratory located in Serrinha do Alambari - RJ - Brazil, from **August 03 to August 17, 2019**. 
Until **5th july**, professionals from different fields can submit proposals to collaborate with those projects.

The selected collaborators will receive lodging and food for the duration of the event.

  **See below for the selected PROJECTS.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

**ECHOES, LOW COST EQUIPMENT FOR BIOACÚSTIC ANALYSIS**  
KEILA ZACHÉ and FABIANA DUFFRAYER | Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.

![](/media/images/ecos.jpg)

The environment has a diversity of languages and presents a sound plasticity with an infinity of melodies that share contrast and resilience.
That is why Ecos proposes the development of an automatic sound recording equipment for terrestrial environments - with good performance, replicable and low cost - based on a pre-existing model. During the lab we will verify the daily sound composition of a locality and measure the effectiveness of the hybrid prototype developed from the sound signal analysis in specific software for this purpose, basic statistical test and the generation of graphics.
 

**Collaborators Profile:**  
Collaborators with knowledge of electronics, programming, aptitude and interest in field studies, audio engineering, sound and biology.

  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      
  
**PHOTOSYNTHETIC PHOTOGRAPHY**  
JOAQUÍN PÁEZ | Córdoba, Argentina.  
  
![](/media/images/fotografiafotossintese.jpg)
  
The project aims to deepen a research on the technique of photosynthetic photography through interdisciplinary experimentation. Its goal is to improve the technique for artistic production. The experimental process will be developed through trial and error tests, making copies in leaves of trees and studying in detail the results of each test etc.

**Collaborators Profile:**
Organic Chemists, Biologists with field experience in the area, artist specializing in natural resins, graphic designer, residents of Serrinha and others interested in research. All of them with experience or interest in a collaborative and interdisciplinary methodology, curious and open-minded.
  
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
        
**ASTRONOMY IMMERSION AND CONTACT WITH THE SKY**  
COSMOS PROJECT | Manaus, AM , Brasil.  
  
![](/media/images/cosmos.jpg)
  
How to transform the pleasant practice of observing the sky, in a tool for knowledge construction? The intention of this project is to investigate and create activities that can be added to the practice of observing the night sky with telescopes and/or planetariums. The Cosmos Project already works with scientific outreach workshops in public schools, and now we want to co-create an immersion in Astronomy open to the public, and empathetic, welcoming, charming and constructive.

**Collaborators Profile:**
Artists in general (musicians, actors, visual and sound artists, illustrators, etc.); people who work on narrative construction (writers, youtubers, writers, storytellers, digital or board game creators, etc.); people who work with science communication, people who work with planetariums, science museums, educommunication etc; Serrinha residents, astronomers, anthropologists, astrologers and other interested parties.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
**RURAL BIOMETANO (CH4)**  
CARIN VON MUHLER and UERJ STUDENTS | Resende, RJ, Brasil.  
  
![](/media/images/biometanorural.jpg)

Small-scale biogas generated from compostable waste is not easily adapted to traditional stoves due to low methane content and high concentration of contaminants. Many of the existing technologies for upgrading biogas to biomethane are costly and incompatible with the needs of a small-scale residential process.
The purpose of this project is to link scientific and popular knowledge, using low-cost and easy-to-acquire materials (or even waste) to build a more accessible system for use on rural properties.

 
**Collaborators Profile:**
People who have some experience with biogas and biometrics, biologists, engineers, chemists, students, farmers, architects, designers, residents of Serrinha.

  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      
      
**BIOMATERIALS**  
CAMILA MACARENA PICCO | Santa Fé, Argentina.  
  
![](/media/images/biomateriais.jpg)
  
Biofabrication of materials and products using organic matter from the Environmental Protection Area of Serrinha do Alambari, Brazil, RJ. The proposal is to combine the artisan process of producing bio-leather and bio-cultured mycelic products, with digital manufacturing tools to process them and create designs. Among these tools, it is proposed, for example, the use of thermoforming, 3D printer, laser cutting, among others. The objective is to generate new materials and evaluate their possible application in biodegradable products that contribute to the care of the environment.
   
**Collaborators Profile:**
Materials engineers, Biologists, Biotechnologists, Technologists, Designers, Artists, Scientists related to the production of biological materials and processes.
